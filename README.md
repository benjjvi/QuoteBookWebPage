# QuoteBookWebPage

A simple **Flask‑powered web application** that lets you browse and share your Quote Book as a neat, user‑friendly web page.

This project takes your collection of quotes (like your **Spoons Quotes quote book**) and renders them in an interactive, searchable, and beautifully formatted website — perfect for sharing with friends or publishing online.

---

## Features

- See quotes beautifully displayed in a web interface
- Built with **Flask** for simplicity and extensibility
- Frontend with HTML/CSS/JS in `templates/` and `static/`
- Python backend in `app.py`
- Animated background canvas with a dark theme
- Easily deploy locally or on hosting like **Render / Heroku / GitHub Pages (via static export)**

## How It Works

The app:

- Loads quotes in a custom format (see `qbformats.py`)
- Uses Flask routes (in `app.py`) to serve pages
- Renders content via Jinja templates in `templates/`
- Assets like CSS and JavaScript live inside `static/`

---

## Deploying

You can deploy this app easily:

- Heroku – standard Python deploy
- Render – deploy from GitHub with auto‑deploy
- GitHub Pages – if you export as static HTML (using a build step)
- PythonAnywhere - drag and drop install.

> ⚡ GitHub Pages only serves static content — if you choose this path, you’ll need to generate static HTML first.
